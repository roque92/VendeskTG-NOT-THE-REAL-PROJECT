The goal of VendeskGT is to provide a seamless ordering system where:
- Teachers or parents can create orders for students.
- Merchants can manage products, inventory, and sales efficiently.

- Merchant registration API is implemented.
- Sensitive data (user and password) is stored in **Firebase Authentication**.
- General merchant data is stored in **PostgreSQL**.
- Email confirmation sent via **Resend**.
- Secrets managed via **Infisical**.
